# TrafficLightSimulation 🚦

This project is a simple **dynamic traffic light control simulation** built using **JavaFX**. It simulates a 4-way intersection with traffic lights, handling the control logic in real-time.

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of the project is to simulate basic traffic light behavior at a four-way intersection, using object-oriented programming principles and JavaFX's graphical capabilities. It serves as a foundational study into animation, simulation logic, and GUI programming in Java.

## 🛠 Features

- 🔄 Dynamic traffic light switching for 4 directions
- 🛣️ Modular road and light system using OOP
- 🧠 Optional auto-input system for randomized testing
- 🎨 JavaFX-based interface and animation
